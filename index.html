         <p>Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) arrives at Port Royal in the Caribbean without a ship or crew. His timing is inopportune, however, because later that evening the town is besieged by a pirate ship. The pirates kidnap the governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), who's in possession of a valuable coin that is linked to a curse that has transformed the pirates into the undead. A gallant blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) in love with Elizabeth allies with Sparrow in pursuit of the pirates.</p>

         <h2 id="lec2">Key information</h2>
         <p>As stated in Dead Man's Chest and At World's End, Black Pearl is "the only ship that can outrun the Dutchman" and this is evidenced in the maelstrom battle between the two ships.</p>
         <p>Originally, the movie was just going to be called Pirates of the Caribbean. However, Disney added “Curse of the Black Pearl” as a subtitle in case they made sequels, and to try and entice potential filmgoers. This annoyed Verbinski, as in the film the Black Pearl is not cursed. The Aztec gold is the cursed object</p>

            I think it the best movie that Disney has ever made, I love the composer of the main theme (john Williams) best composer ever. its been so long since i watched it though.

            It is amazing how poorly this film has aged. It’s pacing is so ploddingly slow, it feels like your time is being plundered. Bloom is vapid, Knightly shows promise, and Depp is the only saving grace. This movies needs the shears.
