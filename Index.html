         <h1>LIFE:</h1>
         <p1>" You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough." â€” Mae West.</p1>
         <h2>WHAT IS LIFE?</h2>
         <p2>As defined by the dictionary, life includes all living organisms responsible for eating, metabolizing, excreting, breathing, moving, growing, reproducing, and responding to environmental factors.</p2>
         <h3>BEGINNING OF LIFE:</h3>
         <p3>We know the earliest life forms to have existed were microscopic organisms (microbes) that left their marks in rocks about 3.7 billion years ago. The signals consisted of a type of carbon molecule that is produced by living things.</p3>
         <h4>IMPORTANCE OF LIFE:</h4>
         <p4>A major reason why life is so important is because the Earth needs fertilizer, which can only be obtained from the dead bodies of living creatures.
         <h5>REASON OF LIFE:</h5>
         <p5>All life forms are driven by a single goal: survival. There is no doubt that this is more important than another key purpose of life, reproduction. Despite being alive, many organisms do not reproduce.
         <h6>EXAMPLE OF LIFE:</h6>      
         <p6>'Humans', 'Animals', and 'Plants' can be considered to be the most basic examples of life.
